      <h2 id="sec1">The Beginning: 1950's to 1972</h2>
      <p>The first true "video game" is widely considered to be <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" target="_blank">Pong</a>, which was released by Atari in 1972. Pong was a simple tennis game that could be played on a television screen
        using two paddles and a ball. However, it's worth noting that there were academic demos prior to Pong that could be considered precursors to video games. These demos were
        usually created for research purposes and weren't marketed or called video games, but they did involve interactive graphics and basic gameplay. Such examples of this were
        <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Strachey" target="_blank">Christopher Strachey's</a> draughts and <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OXO_(video_game)" target="_blank">OXO</a>.
        these games were truly the first software-based games to incorporate a CRT display with human interaction. <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_for_Two" target="_blank">Tennis for Two</a> was the first video game created for entertainment,
        and <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!" target="_blank">Spacewar!</a> was the first
        known digital computer game to be available outside a single research institute. Nevertheless, Pong is often credited with launching the video game industry
        and setting the stage for the explosion of gaming that followed. Thus the title of the first video game is well and truly Pong.  Pong's success also paved the way for the development of more complex
        and sophisticated video games that we see today, making it a significant milestone in the history of gaming. Its impact on popular culture and entertainment cannot be overstated. Located below is a very insightful video by Ahoy
        going over the origins of the first true video game that I highly recommend watching for more information.</p>

      <h2 id="sec2">The Dawn of the Video Game Industry: 1972 to 1983</h2>
      <p>After the commercial success of Pong, the video game industry took off. The industry was split between <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_video_game_console" target="_blank">home consoles</a> and
      <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_video_game" target="_blank">Arcades</a>. The success of Pong skyrocketed the arcade industry when compared to home consoles. Mainly
      the existing catalogue of games was much better for arcades, and home consoles lacked the power in their hardware that arcade cabinets utilized due to their large size. The
      <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey" target="_blank">Magnavox Odyssey</a> was the first commercial video game console released in 1972. Its
      popularity fizzled out fast but one of the 28 games that the Odyssey had ended up being the inspiration for Pong. These early games were primitive but they illustrated the
      potential that video games had. In 1978, <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders" target="_blank">Space Invaders</a> was released, kicking off what
      many consider to be the golden age of the arcade. From 1978 to 1980 video games as an industry went from roughly 308 million in revenue to over 7.7 billion, cementing video games
      as a staple industry in the US. At the same time during the late 70's, home consoles were beginning to generate a buzz as well. The lacking hardware of the past had begun to catch up
      with arcades and many companies began testing the waters of home consoles. Early examples like the <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600"target="_blank">Atari 2600</a>
      caught on with consumers, and by turning popular arcade games into home console versions, many companies were able to increase the sales of early home consoles. Finally, the last development
      during this period was the emergence of third party developers, companies that developed games for hardware that was not their own, a notable example of this would be
      <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision"target="_blank">Activision</a>.

      <h2 id="sec3">The Video Game Crash of 1983</h2>
      <p> Following Activision's success as a third party developer, many companies chose to take the same route during the 80's. There were hundreds of third party companies itching to break into
        the industry. However many of these companies were poorly staffed and backed by investors that were not knowledgeable in the video game industry. The results of this were games lacking
        polish and of poor quality. As a result, the market of games for the most popular console the 2600, was bogged down. By 1983, the lack of quality and the deterioration of consumer confidence
        in the industry leader Atari caused the industry to experience a severe crash. In North America alone, profits dropped from 3 billion to only 100 million by 1985. As a result of this
        many companies exited the industry after determining that it was not sustainable to stay afloat. </p>

      <h2 id="sec4">Japan Takes the Throne: 1985</h2>
      <p>While the aforementioned crash of 1983 devastated the industry in North America, the Japanese video game industry came out unscathed. In the same year as the crash, <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System"target="_blank">Nintendo</a>
      introduced their system, the <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System"target="_blank">Famicom</a>, while their rival <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega"target="_blank">Sega</a> released the
      <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SG-1000"target="_blank">SG-1000</a>. These consoles were extremely popular and the Famicom alone sold 2.5 million units in Japan. These Japanese
      companies recognized the potential that the North American market had, but there was multiple issues that needed to be fixed first. Firstly, the overwhelming negative stigma towards video games needed to be curbed.
      when Nintendo rebranded their Famicom to the Nintendo Entertainment System for the North American market, they redesigned the outside to be more mature and less toy like. Secondly, they recognized the lack of quality Games
      that led to the demise of Atari, so they strictly limited the amount of games that third parties could make per year and also charged a steep fee to release games officially on the console. Nintendo also implemented an
      official seal of approval on their game boxes to further discourage buyers from purchasing any games that were not self published by Nintendo. With these systems in place, home consoles took off with Nintendo at the forefront, by 1989 the market
      for cartridge based consoles was worth nearly 2 billion dollars. Also notable during this time was the emergence of several big name franchises that have stood the test of time. This includes the likes of
      the <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario"target="_blank">Super Mario</a>, <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)"target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda</a>, and
      <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_(video_game)"target="_blank">Metroid</a> franchises most notably, as well as third party titles like <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_(video_game)"target="_blank">Metal Gear</a>,
      <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_(video_game)"target="_blank">Final Fantasy</a>, and <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania_(1986_video_game)"target="_blank">Castlevania</a>. These are only a few of the memorable
      franchises and games that launched during this era.

      <h2 id="sec5">Technological Advancements: 1986 to 2000</h2>
      <p>From the release of the NES and onwards, the video game industry experienced a never before seen period of innovation. By the tail end of the 80's the two major players in the industry
      Nintendo and Sega both released 16bit consoles, these consoles dramatically improved every aspect when compared to their prior 8bit counterparts, notably most 16bit consoles supported disc formats. Sega's <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis"target="_blank">Genesis</a>
      started slow after its 1989 release, but after lowering the price and bundling the console together with the game <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(1991_video_game)"target="_blank">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>
      Sega was able to make a significant dent in Nintendo's market dominance. In 1991, Nintendo launched its own 16bit console, the <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System"target="_blank">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, or SNES for short.
      it boasted similar upgrades to fidelity like the Genesis, and the two companies continued along locked in a "console war" until 1994. Enter <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment"target="_blank">Sony</a>
      in an industry that had only been accustomed to 2D graphics all of its life, Sony shook the entire industry with the launch of the <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)"target="_blank">Playstation</a>.
      The Playstation was capable of true 3D graphics and brought the opportunity to create many new games once thought to be impossible to make. Gran Turismo, Tomb Raider, Metal Gear, Tekken, and Final Fantasy are among
      the most successful franchises that got their big break on the Playstation. This shift in the industry also signalled a shift in dominance to Sony, by the year 2000 they were the dominant player in the console market.
      </p>
      <p>But remember, consoles werent the only way of playing video games at the time either. So far I have deliberately left out home computers from the mix, as they never really had a large following until the 90's. but
        with the dawn of the internet, and the versatility of using mouse and keyboard as an input method, PCs quickly took a foothold in the gaming industry. Genres of games like MMOS, Realtime strategy games, and First Person Shooters all experienced a rise to prominence during this period
        In addition to computers, handheld consoles also began to pick up steam, the <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy"target="_blank">Game Boy</a> from Nintendo was the first to truly hit its stride and find commercial success, which only continued going forwards.

      <h2 id="sec6">The Modern Age: 2000's to Present Day</h2>
      <p> By this point it is fairly certain, video games are here to stay. With the sheer amount of polish on a technical level on all fronts, there is no longer the risk of a crash like the 80's. There are now so many standards and
        policies in place that game developers and publishers can effectively produced new games on the bleeding edge of what is possible with current hardware. The main advancement of note other than new games and better hardware was the
        standard integration of online play. Although a niche market on PCs in the early 90's, playing online quickly picked up relevance and with the progression of the internet and interconnectivity worldwide, playing online has become
        the standard for making a successful videogame nowadays. But the reason that I love video games is because that isnt even everything, there are so many topics that I could continue to cover for hours but for the sake of your sanity and
        mine, this is where I will end off the timeline for today. Again, another great video on the evolution of graphics by Ahoy is linked below if you are interested in learning more.
