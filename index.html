      <h2>What this website will teach you</h2>
      <p>This website is highlighting a personal interest of mine, video games. Video games are a staple of many peoples lives and they will continue
      to be that for many more people in the future too. The goal of this website is to explore a bit about the history of video games creating a timeline
      of important events along the way. I will also talk about some different genres of video games and the impact that the video game industry has had on the world.</p>

      <h2>Some important background information</h2>
      <p>Before we begin, I should probably provide some background information to those of you who dont really understand what a video game is. In the simplest terms, a video games
      is an interactive piece of entertainment. You are using a device (most likely a controller), to manipulate the screen directly, and in a variety of different ways. In the dictionary
      a video game is defined as "an electronic game in which players control images on a video screen". If you still dont understand think of it
      this way, you manipulate a video game in the same way as a board game, but just through a different means of input. To further enhance this idea, think of monopoly, a classic board
      game, well I bet you didnt know that there actually exists <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)#Video_games" target="_blank">7 different monopoly video games</a>.
      The games have sold millions of copies and also demonstrate how lucrative the industry can be, but I will touch on that later.</p>
