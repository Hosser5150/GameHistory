    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hopefully you have read the first page on the history of games before we delve into different types of games, but if not thats ok. The goal of this page is to wrap up some last bits of information and to provide
        a closer look at the games themselves rather than the industry and technology side. Video game genres refer to the categorization of video games based on their gameplay mechanics, themes, and settings. Understanding
        different genres can help gamers make informed choices when selecting games to play.  I will cover a breif evolution of some of these game genres and talk about some notable examples along the way too. But, without further
        ado lets begin.</p>

    <h2>First Person Shooters</h2>
      <p> The first-person shooter (FPS) genre began in the early 1990s with games like <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D" target="_blank">Wolfenstein 3D</a> and <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(franchise)" target="_blank">Doom</a>.
        It is arguably the most popular genre nowadays when compared to others. These games are notable for their fast-paced,
        action-packed gameplay and their use of 3D graphics. FPS games are a popular genre that simulates combat from the perspective of the player. These games usually involve the use of guns and other weapons to defeat enemies,
        and players can explore different environments, complete objectives, and engage in ever popular multiplayer modes. Some popular examples of FPS games include <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty" target="_blank">Call of Duty</a>,
        <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_(video_game_series)" target="_blank">Battlefield</a>, and <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(franchise)" target="_blank">Halo</a>. In the mid-1990s, games like
        <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)" target="_blank">Quake</a> and
        <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_(1998_video_game)" target="_blank">Unreal</a> introduced multiplayer modes, which allowed players to compete against each other online. The genre continued to evolve in the
        2000s with games like <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)" target="_blank">Half-Life</a>, its sequel Half-Life 2 and many others. These games had more complex storylines, advanced graphics, and improved artificial intelligence for enemies.

    <h2>MMO Games</h2>
      <p>MMO games are a genre that allows players to interact with other players in a virtual world. These games can involve completing quests, battling monsters, and leveling up characters. Players can also form groups or
        guilds to complete objectives and take part in player-versus-player battles. Some popular examples of MMO games include <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft" target="_blank">World of Warcraft</a>,
        <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XIV" target="_blank">Final Fantasy XIV</a> , and <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_Wars_2" target="_blank">Guild Wars 2</a>. Of all genres, MMOs are the most diverse in terms of gameplay
        but people always come back to them because of the sense of progression and a feeling of interconnectivity not felt in any other genre of game. This genre is the closest that we have got to true virtual worlds in my opinion.
        In terms of the history of MMOs, the MMO genre began in the late 1990s with games like <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Online" target="_blank">Ultima Online</a> and
        <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverQuest" target="_blank">EverQuest</a>. In the 2000s, games like World of Warcraft and Guild Wars introduced more advanced graphics, larger worlds,
        and more complex gameplay. These games became incredibly popular and paved the way for the modern MMO genre. Interestingly, MMOs are also the only genre where these old games have actually stayed popular and in some cases are even
        more popular than their modern counterparts. One example of this would be <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_RuneScape" target="_blank">oldschool Runescape</a> compared to modern runescape, where the former is bigger than the latter.

    <h2>Racing Games</h2>
      <p> Racing games have been a popular genre since the early days of video games. The first racing game, called <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race" target="_blank">Space Race</a>, was released in 1973 by Atari.
        The game involved two players racingspaceships on a black-and-white screen. In the 1980s, arcade racing games like <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run" target="_blank">Out Run</a> and <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_Position" target="_blank">Pole Position</a> became popular.
        These games had more realistic graphics and featured different types of vehicles like cars and motorcycles. In the 1990s, racing games started to become more popular on home consoles like the Sega Genesis and the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Games like
        <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Kart" target="_blank">Super Mario Kart</a> and <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Zero" target="_blank">F-Zero</a>
        introduced elements of fantasy and power-ups to the genre. Nowadays, games like <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed" target="_blank">Need for Speed</a>, <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Horizon_5" target="_blank">Forza Horizon 5</a>, and
        <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Turismo_7" target="_blank">Gran Turismo 7</a> make up a large market for racing games with outliers like
        <a class="linkText" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_8" target="_blank">Mario Kart 8</a> enjoying their own sections as well.
        Interestingly, racing games are also the easiest genre to explain how there are almost subgenres. For example, racing games can be split between simulation
        and arcade style racing. Arcade racers are generally much more lax and dont tend towards realism very much at all, whereas simulation games have reached a point of incredible realism. Simulation racing games have gotten to
        the point where real life Formula One drivers practice on these simulators. As well, computer processing power has advanced so much that these simulation games can go so far as simulating wind, rain, dirt, and even realistic tire deformation in realtime (meaning not prerendered).

    <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In conclusion, video game genres have evolved over time, and each genre has its own unique history. Racing games, FPS games, and MMO games have all undergone significant changes since their inception, but they continue to be popular today. Understanding the history of each genre
        can provide insights into how they have evolved and become popular today.
